I want you to build a simple functional prototype called EcoLedger – “Trustworthy Carbon, Transparent Future”. This prototype is for a hackathon, so focus on clarity and demo value over perfection.

🎯 Goal:

A web-based dashboard where NGOs can record mangrove planting activities, get verified carbon credits, and where buyers can view & purchase those credits. Blockchain will be simulated (not fully implemented) but should look real enough for demo purposes.

1. Frontend (React / Next.js with Tailwind CSS)

Landing page with project name + login options (NGO / Buyer).

NGO Dashboard:

Form to input plantation activity (e.g., number of mangroves planted, GPS location, upload image).

On submit → credits are calculated (rule: 1 ton CO₂ = 1 credit; approximate conversion = 100 mangroves = 1 credit).

Display “Credits Earned” on NGO profile.

Buyer Dashboard:

List of available credits from NGOs.

Option to “Buy Credits” → simulate with button click and fake transaction.

Use Google Maps Embed API to display plantation location (based on NGO input).

2. Backend (Flask or Node.js – whichever easier)

Handle two user roles: NGO and Buyer.

Store data in simple DB (SQLite or Firebase or even JSON). Fields:

NGO_ID, Plantation_Data, GPS_Location, Credits_Earned, Status (Verified/Pending).

Add API endpoint:

/add_plantation → NGO adds plantation data.

/get_credits → Fetch NGO credits.

/marketplace → Fetch available credits for buyers.

/buy_credit → Buyer “purchases” credits (simulate by transferring ownership).

3. Blockchain Simulation

Instead of real blockchain, create a Ledger Page:

Every transaction (NGO earns credit / Buyer buys credit) → logged with:

Transaction ID (random unique hash like 0xA23F9...).

Date & Time.

NGO ID.

Credits Earned / Sold.

Display this as a blockchain-like table.

4. Verification

When NGO submits plantation, mark it as “Pending Verification.”

Add a “Verify” button (for admin/judge demo).

On click → mark as ✅ Verified and credits become available in marketplace.

5. UI Flow for Demo

NGO logs in → adds plantation data → uploads proof → system shows “10 credits earned, Pending Verification.”

Admin verifies → credits move to NGO’s balance.

Buyer logs in → sees credits in marketplace → clicks “Buy” → transaction shows in ledger.

6. Extra Notes

Keep design clean, hackathon-ready (use Tailwind CSS).

Fake payment can just show “Payment Successful” popup.

Deploy on Replit and make sure it runs with one click.

💡 Final Output Needed:

A working web app with NGO & Buyer dashboards.

Simulated blockchain ledger page showing transactions.

Simple and fast enough to demo live in 3–4 minutes.
