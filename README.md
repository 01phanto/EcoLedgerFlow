# EcoLedgerFlow
EcoLedger is a web-based carbon credit marketplace connecting NGOs that plant mangroves with buyers seeking verified carbon credits. The platform provides transparency through a simulated blockchain ledger system, allowing NGOs to record plantation activities, earn carbon credits through verification, and enabling buyers to purchase these credits.
